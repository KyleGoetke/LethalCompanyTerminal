Roaming Locusts
Scientific name: Anacridium-vega
Sigurd's danger level: 0%

Known as roaming locusts, this is a species of grasshopper. Unlike some species which are more prone to jump or fly, roaming locusts are almost never grounded and stay close together even when in smaller numbers. They will quickly disperse when a predator disrupts them but are highly attracted to light.
